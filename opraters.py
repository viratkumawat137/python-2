# # 1. Arithmetic Operators
# num1 = 40
# num2 = 8


# print(num1 - num2)       # subtraction
# print(num1 * num2)       # multiplication




# 2. Assignment Operators
# value = 50
# print(value)

# value -= 10              # subtract and assign
# print(value)


# # 3. Comparison Operators
# p1 = 18
# p2 = 18
# print(p1 == p2)           # less than comparison

# p3 = 30
# p4 = 25
# print(p3 > p4)           # greater than comparison


# # 4. Logical Operators
# x1 = 5
# x2 = 15
# x3 = 25
# x4 = 35

# print("And result :", x1 < x2 and x3 > x4)   # AND condition
# print("OR Result :", x1 < x2 or x3 > x4)  # OR condition  esko ek chiz true caheyee bs 


# # 5. Identity Operators -
# m1 = 100
# m2 = 100
# print(m1 is m2)


# 6. Membership Operators
# print("Check 'a' in 'mango' :", 'a' in 'mango')
